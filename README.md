# Gesture-Controlled-Robotic-Arm



The goal of this project is to make a gesture controlled robotic arm via wireless grove. I am going to split the work into four main stages,
 3D printing The robot arm, wiring the circuitry in the arm, wireless glove sensors, doing analog to digital signal processing, and coding the input/output ports to do what you want it to do according to the processed signal - which would then translate into actuations of the arm according to what’s connected to each output port.
 Due to signal processing being underdeveloped with no clear way to measure body signal as it is
very low in voltage and the field doesn’t have too much research backing it, meaning this project would still be a
somewhat fresh idea. This is a very important project as many people suffer from motor disabilities
from a stroke or neurological impairments; and these people have a very hard time navigating through life
without one. Additionally, as this project will encompass not just the codework and the circuitry but also
the physical building of the arm, the entire project could in theory be repeatable from start to finish by
someone else when it is neatly documented.

 Introduction
 
 We are developing a means to control a robotic arm via noninvasive wearable sensor circuits, we will
accomplish this in real world applications. The sensor circuits we will be using are a flex sensor and IMU
sensor for our application. This processed signal will be A/D converted and used to create control systems
to actuate the robot arm with gestures from wireless glove. The sensor circuit consists of essentially a
wearable glove with flex sensors and an IMU sensor embedded within the glove as well. This circuit will
use the flex sensors embedded into each finger position to measure the change in resistance as the fingers
begin to move, and our IMU sensor will be placed on the top of the hand to measure the velocity and
angle that the wrist can turn. The combination of these specific two sensors (flex & IMU) can allow
movement for the robot arm and has possible applications for stroke victims with limited motor functions
to control impaired limbs.This project has a huge significance and impact on several different levels, not only is the research
into how sensors can be best adapted to help the human well-being, but this project also has the potential
to apply these robots in situations where it might not be safe for a human to enter. The benefit of further
research into wearable sensors and signal processing in general is a great industry for the medical uses
and benefits from being able to detect better reading from the human body to improve motor functionality
and wellbeing of life and within the body. Having a wearable device that can control a robot for situations
that humans cannot enter is another benefit from this field of study, imagine being able to help rehabilitate
people that suffer from mobility issues or using a robot to help with natural and man-made disasters.
